## San Francisco

No, this is not our bank sort code; it's the number of floors we tried rooms at the [Hyatt Regency Downtown SOMA](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-regency/en-US/sford-hyatt-regency-san-francisco-downtown-soma) on before we settled on one that suited us. Mustafa and the team at the front desk have the patience of saints.

### Things we learnt whilst in San Francisco:

import FactsText from '@components/FactsText.astro'

<FactsText>There is sufficient steel rope in the Golden Gate Bridge to go round the world 5 times; now why would you want to do that?</FactsText>

<FactsText>Even on a wet day the [Salesforce Sky Garden](https://www.tjpa.org/salesforce-transit-center/salesforce-park) is impressive in its scale and variety of planting.</FactsText>

<FactsText>The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus put on a great concert with perfect diction and tuning, even with 20% of the 200+ singers wearing face masks. Oh, and they were lots of fun including several Cher moments. Oh, and the audience were significantly middle class straight families.</FactsText>

<FactsText>It rains a lot in San Francisco.</FactsText>
<FactsText>Toilets, which are located in "restrooms", flush super efficiently.</FactsText>
<FactsText>Whilst the neighbourhoods are distinct the overall feeling of friendliness and welcoming is felt in every corner of this city; maybe the ever present aroma of a certain 5 fingered green plant helps with this.</FactsText>
<FactsText>We loved Union/Polk Streets. It helped that the sun was shining.</FactsText>
<FactsText>Union Square is home to some super rich stores.</FactsText>
<FactsText>A block away from Union Square are people who carry all their processions in a plastic bag, if they are fortunate enough to have one.</FactsText>
<FactsText>Homelessness, addiction and lack of health care are huge issues in this city of contradictions.</FactsText>
<FactsText> For both of us, San Francisco remains a favourite city. This was our first time visiting together, we hope it won't be our last..... we still need to ride a cable car together!</FactsText>
